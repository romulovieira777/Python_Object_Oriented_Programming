Objects variables are defined in a Class

You can have more than one class in a program.

Example:

Create Objects Car, Motorbike with class Vehicle.

Create Object Bob with the class Human.

If a Motorbike would be created from class Human, it would have eyes and legs. Classes define the objects variables.
