Introduction

What is serialization?

Objects can be serialized:  converted into a text string

This "text string" can be stored into a file.  Then you can load that text again later and reconstruct the object.

There are some standard formats to convert objects into text

JSON format

YAML format

Pickle format (not human readable)
