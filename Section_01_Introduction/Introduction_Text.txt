There are different ways to organize your code.

The most basic approach is just to have command after command:

engine = on
rotateWheels = true
...

Then you could organize the code in functions, functional programming:

start()
turnLeft()
drive()
turnRight()
stop()
...

Another way is to organize your code in objects: Object Oriented Programming

robot1.start()
robot1.turnLeft()
robot1.drive()
robot1.turnRight()
robot1.stop()

In this course we'll explain Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
